        <p> <span style="color: red;">Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</span> After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.</p>
        <p>I've started putting up a <span style="color: blue;"><ins>slide show</ins></span> of the production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site. If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please contact me.</p>
        <p>Once again: <span style="color: red;">BRAVO!!!</span> -- Mrs. Juroszek</p>
